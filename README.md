### Warmup Stage
In this stage, we are introduced to the program's workings and receive some background information about the [Founder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kadhiravan-jayachandiran/). As a starting point, we are granted free access to an [MS Excel Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/105y9C3@JHRUMVcCP2sJDxSMWvCwkGcKwYdARKXfYxQSy9EE4zoGSv5DOXV-ii2YfhlDRdmDtA==/). Following that, our initial task is to complete our [First Milestone](https://github.com/SSonwane26/KultureHire_Journey/blob/main/Milestones/MileStone_01_Saurabh_Sonwane.xlsx) and submit it for evaluation. 

About Course
- The structure of Excel and how its applications function, from basic to advanced formulas used for analysis.
- The creation and use of pivot tables and place a particular focus on dashboard creation with pivot tables, including the development of interactive dashboards with advanced customization options.

### The Actual Start
We have received our official offer letter, marking the beginning of our journey as a 'learntern.' At this stage, we embark on our actual project or mission, which is centered around **Understanding the Career Aspirations of Gen Z**. As any analysis begins with a well-defined problem statement, our first task is to thoroughly approach and comprehend this problem statement. To achieve this, we conduct in-depth research, including the exploration of news articles, blogs, and other relevant sources. Subsequently, we compile all our research findings into a comprehensive document, often referred to as a 'Business Requirement Document.' This document encompasses our research, considerations regarding the problem statement, and ultimately serves as our submission for the completion of the next [Milestone](https://github.com/SSonwane26/KultureHire_Journey/blob/main/Milestones/MileStone_03_Saurabh_Sonwane.pdf) in our journey.

### Collect The Date
After gaining a clear understanding of the problem statement, our next crucial step is the collection of data and a comprehensive grasp of the data variables. Since our problem pertains to the real world, we need real-world data to work with. To achieve this, we employ a survey method, wherein we create a Google Form containing approximately 15 to 20 essential questions. This survey is pivotal in addressing our project goals. Upon completion, we achieve our next milestone by submitting our version of the Google Form link. 

Furthermore, we disseminate this survey link across various social media platforms, including [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ssonwane26_kulturehire-genzcareersurvey-youthempowerment-activity-7096154342684016640-xXsd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), to gather valuable data for our analysis. This survey data collection process is vital for our analysis and research.

### Preprocessing Stage
Following the data collection phase, our next imperative step involves the cleaning and standardization of the collected data. During this stage, we are introduced to a new analysis tool and language, specifically MySQL Workbench using SQL. To facilitate our learning of SQL, we are provided with free access to a [SQL Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/109jhG3@qUIVFneWUb7-C3AHl0gqOc9Q8sP1Jm5Ozy8VmUURuTLLSKOL-avxu-A6ByCPCJI33g==/). This course covers a range of topics, including the MySQL Workbench interface, the potential of SQL, distinctions between databases and spreadsheets, as well as an introduction to various functions, statements, operators, and clauses, accompanied by coding exercises and assignments.

For the data cleaning process, we employ MySQL. Our tasks involve removing unwanted rows, renaming columns, and categorizing the questionnaire data into four separate tables, namely 'Mission Aspirations', 'Manager Aspirations', 'Learning Aspirations' and 'Personal Info'. Subsequently, we proceed to perform some preliminary analysis to validate the cleanliness and accuracy of our data. This comprehensive process allows us to successfully complete this [Milestone](https://github.com/SSonwane26/KultureHire_Journey/blob/main/Milestones/MileStone_06_Saurabh_Sonwane.sql) in our journey.

### Lets Analyzed Them
In this stage, we delve into in-depth analysis using MySQL, addressing complex questions and uncovering intriguing insights about the influencing factors on Gen Z, their future year goals, educational aspirations, salary expectations, and much more. This phase of our journey enables us to gain a profound understanding of the data and successfully complete this [Milestone](https://github.com/SSonwane26/KultureHire_Journey/blob/main/Milestones/MileStone_07_Saurabh_Sonwane.sql).

### Creating Dashboard
Following the data analysis, our next focus is on presenting the data in a visualization format. During this stage, we are introduced to visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. I personally prefer and use Power BI due to its user-friendly interface, especially after working with MS Excel. The primary objective is to create a generalized version of a Power BI dashboard.

The process of creating the dashboard involves importing data into Power Query, with our data source being the MySQL database. Since the data has already been cleaned, the task primarily involves renaming and adding necessary columns. Subsequently, we model the tables in the Model view of Power BI and utilize charts and graphs to extract more valuable insights. Once the dashboard is ready, we submit our version as part of the [Milestone](https://github.com/SSonwane26/KultureHire_Journey/blob/main/Milestones/Milestone_08_Saurabh_Sonwane.pdf) completion process.

### Focus more on Insights
During this stage, our focus shifts to each of the aspiration tables, which correspond to the four tables we've created. We are tasked with formulating questions and providing answers through the use of charts and graphs. The objective is to create a comprehensive report within Power BI, and the successful completion of this [Milestone](https://github.com/SSonwane26/KultureHire_Journey/blob/main/Milestones/Milestone_09_Saurabh_Sonwane.pdf) marks our progress as we move on to the next stage in our journey.

### Tell The Story
In the final stage of our journey, we need to bring all the components together, from defining the problem statement to data collection, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The challenge is to convey this entire process to another person effectively, utilizing storytelling techniques to ensure that the complex story, particularly one involving numbers and data, is understandable to a wide audience. To facilitate this, we researched articles and blogs on storytelling techniques, especially how to communicate complex stories with numbers in a way that everyone can comprehend.

For our final presentation, we employed PowerPoint to craft a compelling narrative that encapsulated our entire analysis journey. The ultimate goal of this presentation is to select one company and provide recommendations based on our analysis. This recommendation is crucial because our analysis addresses a real-world problem, and applying our findings to a significant business scenario can open up new opportunities for candidates.

In my [Final Presentation](https://www.linkedin.com/events/understandinggen-zwithsourabhso7118093168146857984/theater/), I chose to focus on Reliance Jio. With this, we successfully conclude our internship program, having completed all the [Milestones](https://github.com/SSonwane26/KultureHire_Journey/blob/main/Milestones/Milestone_10_Saurabh_Sonwane.pdf), including this final one, and gaining valuable insights and experience throughout our journey.
